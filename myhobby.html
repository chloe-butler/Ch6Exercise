    <p>I absolutely love playing pickleball on a nice day with my friends. It is such a fun sport
        to be competitive in and also have a great time! The game is sort of like tennis and ping pong mixed together
        to give closer range, but also that tennis feeling. I would totally recommed playing this game
        with friends and family!
